# Spoilboard

Spoilboard setup on a [OneFinity Journeyman Elite](https://www.onefinitycnc.com/product-page/elite-series-journeyman-48-x32-cut-area) with a QCW frame.  

Utilizes one or more sacrifical layers on top of the QCW slats.

## Advantages

* Multiple levels provide felxibility, minimize torque, and protect the QCW slats
* Alignment pins maintain a high-degree of repeatable accuracy
* Embedded hurricane nuts allow for secure, low-profile hold-downs
* Follows the "MFT Standard" 96mm grid spacing

## Disadvantages

* Not ideal where a maximum z-range is needed
* "MFT Standard" adds complexity, a simpler grid system would be better

## Steps

1. Flatten QCW boards
2. Machine [Outer Alignment Holes](outer_alignment_holes.md)
3. Setup lower spoilboard blank
4. [Add Fastening Holes](fastening_holes.md)

## Materials

* [1/4" Alignment Pins McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/131/3826/98381A542)
